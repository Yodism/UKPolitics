          <!-- Description -->
          <div class="p-t-b-15">
            <p>House of commons and house of lords:<br> <br>
If we get elected we will change the amount of members of parliament we have from 650 to 420, this means that we will be reducing the amount of constituencies there are. 211 seats in the house of commons will be required for a majority. We will decrease the amount of people in the house of lords from 300 to 69. These changes will be made to help strengthen democracy in the United Kingdom. <br> <br> 
Economic policy: <br> <br> If you are homeless, get a house, very simple this is the reason why we would immediately abolish any schemes to help people to get houses, we will also not give you any houses or anything related even if you say you need it as you will be lying. Just buy a house. If you are in poverty, get a better job this is why we will stop any schemes to help people get food or anything else as if they need that they are just trying to be lazy. Any "good" banks or other charities which help people be lazy will immediately be made illegal and if one is discovered, the company or charity will have to pay 150% of their worth, if they do not comply the founders and the CEO will be chucked be in prison for life. All the workers have all their money and anything else they own taken off them and sold for money as they did not inform us that this illegal activity was going on. Although, every year we will take all the wealth from the richest 1% of people and take 90% of it to fund our government; we will then redistribute the other 10% to the top percent of people who read our manifestos the most amount of times. If you want to keep your wealth, you have to read this manifesto more times than 99 percent of the population. We will also restart the industrial revolution and make our Gross Domestic Product 5 times bigger within 4 years of being elected into office. We will attempt to make our Gross Domestic Product higher than China and the United States Of America within 24 years. We will restore the British Empire at the peak of its time within 12 years. We will restore the greatness of the British Empire and the british people will recieve great benefits.
  <br> <br> Healthcare Policy: <br> <br> We think that the United States healthcare system is going in the right direction, but we want to go further than it already is. Healthcare is a privilege, not a human right. Remember that. Back in the good old days people did not have all the modern medicine we have today, people just toughed illnesses out and people's immune systems were great. We will ban all antibiotics, care for the weak, or anything else that was not around in the 1700s. This will make the population left have stronger immune systems and they will be much healthier. Although, we will make a special exception for those who vote for us in the next General Election as you are the people we want in our country.
  <br> <br> Education policy: <br> <br> Children do not need education, they can work on potato farms. Once they have spent 10 years on a potato farm we will teach them basic maths, reading and writing for £75,000 a year of education at the parents/childs expense higher education costs £150,000 a year. Do not worry though, there are loans! Although they have a 750% interest rate but it is great in the short term. We are privatizing ouer schools to a company called: YodaDoesGreatEducation hence why the costs will go up by a small amount.
<br> <br> Enviromental Policy: <br> <br> Climate change does not exist. North Korea is heating the earth with heat bombs. To respond to this attack we will require every British Citizen to have a fridge that is constantly open. Once the earth cools back down we will all be able to close our fridges again! Lots of people say that we are running out of fresh water, all we need to do is get some water from the sea and drink it. Simple as that. Regarding fossil fuels: they do not 'heat up the earth' that is all North Korea heating up the Earth. All the scientists saying otherwise are being bribed by Kim Jong Un, we know this due to leaked emails that we managed to get. Climate change is a lie made up by Kim Jong Un; to hide that he constantly heats the earth with his heat bombs. Even if Climate Change does exist, which it doesn't, it affects foreigners more than us so it is fine. <br> <br>
Brexit Policy: <br> <br> We do not only want to leave the European Union but the North Atlantic Treaty Orginisation as well. This is because of the huge amount of money they cost us. We will use the money we save from being in this groups on rebuilding the British Empire and restarting the Industrial Revolution. We will ban all trade that is not in British Borders as this will remove any taxes and the cost to import things, this will make everything you buy much cheaper. We will make the British Empire self sufficient and bring it back to its former glory! <br> <br>

          <div class="p-t-b-15">
            <p>House of Representives and The Senate: <br> <br> We will change the amount of people in the House of Representatives from 435 Representatives to 420. We will change the amount of Senators in The Senate from 100 to 69. We will make a third house. This house will be a religious house of Yodists. We will call it the House of Yodists. It will have 69420 members and will fully represent the population of all states and territories. The House of Yodists will be able to veto the House of Representatives and The Senate if they get a majority of votes. If the House of Yodists gets a majority of votes on every law/other proposal, they do not need permission from the House of Representatives or The Senate and it will immediately be put into law. <br> <br>
Ecconomic Policy: <br> <br> The first action we do when elected into office is to demand China give us 80 million free pacifiers a year. President Trump is only waging a trade war; this is not enough. If we do not get the 80 million pacifiers; we will send all people responsible for the decision homosexual prostitutes; and let the prostitute do whatever they want. We will also bribe people close to them to constantly keep their clothes damp, and we will make all their food slightly soggy. This will be much more effective than the trade war and will not effect us in any way whatsoever. We will not help the homeless; as they need to just get a house. Simple. If you are in poverty you need to get a better job. Extremely simple; if people did this homeless and unemployment rates would drop to 0% in a matter of days. We will also strengthen Turkey and tell them to declare war on greece; so the United States of America can have some land on mainland Europe.
